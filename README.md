# Changes in global heat waves and its socioeconomic exposure in a warmer future

Heat waves have attracted worldwide concern, while its global changes and socioeconomic impacts still need further study. 

Using three historical reanalysis data and multi scenario CMIP6 modeled data, Global Heat Wave Toolbox (GHWT) was developed to generate heat wave matrix from 1971 to 2100. 

The long-term changing characteristics of global heat waves were also analyzed. Next, population and GDP projections are employed to estimate future socioeconomic exposure and risks.
